### Frog

There was one frog jumping around. Her favourite word was "kwa". She was green and shiny. The frog lived in the lake that was small and round, sometimes on a t-shirt of a boy. While being around the lake, she was too tiny to realise that the lake is small, and every day she would travel around the lake and always though that it's sort of magic that she goes straight but always comes back home. But we all, related to the story, know that it was not magic at all.

She made some kind of weird friendship with a fly. Nobody likes flies, but the frog had open personally, according to a psychological test she took once, she was an extrovert and an altruist. However, that was not it. The fly knew a lot of stories and she has been through many adventures in her life. She would always tell the stories to the frog. 

Once she told a story how she was a subject of an experiment that some crazy scientist conducted. And it was kind of interesting for her and life-changing because then the fly realised that she tastes food with her legs, not with her so called proboscis. How does it work you probably want to know? The scientist invited a fly to drink a sweet syrup but with the only condition, to put her legs into the water. The fly agreed as she just loves syrup. She was about to start but something weird happened. She could not drink it. Desperate. Then the scientist suggested to turn things around: put her legs into syrup and try the water! And what do you think happened? The fly never tried such a tasty water before.
Bob, the scientist, explained everything to her. From that time she has thought she is very special. Her name was Olenka.

So, Olenka was very extravagant, trendy and special, as we already have understood. The fly was coming to the lake every day, set next to the frog and told her stories and what happened during a day. The frog was looking forward toÂ seeing the fly, she tried to collect her own stories, to have something to say to the fly as well. She didn't want to be boring. 

Once the fly didn't come. First, the frog though it must be that she was so boring that the fly found someone else to hang out with, to share stories and laugh out loud. But after, she realised that it must have something happened to Olenka. Poor Olenka, she must be stuck somewhere in a spider neat or even worse killed by a human being. No, no, no! It can't be true. And the frog has started to cry. Then rain has started so we do not know long she was crying. 

The frog could not eat in depth of despair. Fortunatelly, the next day Olenka brought her exhausted body back. She said to the frog that she had some misunderstanding with the wind, it was too strong, there was some tension between both of them. Sorry for the delay, - the only Olenka has said and told to the frog her best story ever.
